Welcome to the Group B Year 3 Project repo.

Latest notes from Justin: 

Halfway through writing the maze simulation script. Decided to use PyGame because of its great built-in collision detection functions and relatively simple graphics. Can now simulate motion of the ball on a tilted surface. 

To do:
-Add TypeExceptions for theta and other inputs. 
-Add written information onto the display. 
-Optimise graphics. 
-Add object collision.
