Welcome to the Group B Year 3 Project repo.

Notes for Justin: 

Halfway through writing the maze simulation script. Decided to use PyGame because of its great built-in collision detection functions and relatively simple graphics. Can now simulate motion of the ball on a tilted surface. 

To do:
-Add TypeExceptions for theta and other inputs. 
-Add written information onto the display. 
-Optimise graphics. 
-Add object collision. 
-Research licensing
-Contact JJ about camera
-Email Shuangyi
-Software compensate for theta
-Ball overlap with walls?

Notes for Pranay:

Ball class: np.array(x,y)
Wall class: np.array(x,y), np.array(Sx,Sy)
Hole class: np.array(x,y)
Waypoint class: np.array(x,y)
